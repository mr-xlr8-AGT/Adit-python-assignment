            <h2>Introduction: The Recurring Specter of Financial Collapse</h2>
            <p>Financial markets have demonstrated a remarkable tendency toward periodic crises separated by intervals of 6-10 years. Between 2000 and 2025, the global financial system has experienced three major asset bubbles, each preceded by similar warning signs and followed by widespread destruction of capital, employment, and investor confidence.</p>
